# Gabo RAG

**'Gabo'** is a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system designed to enhance the capabilities of **LLMs (Large Language Models)** such as **'Llama 3.1'** or **'Phi 3.5**'. This project honors Colombian author **Gabriel García Márquez** by marking the tenth anniversary of his death, creating a specialized assistant to answer questions about his work, and using new technologies to further reveal his literary legacy.
